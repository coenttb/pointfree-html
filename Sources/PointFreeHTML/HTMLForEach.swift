/// A component that creates HTML content for each element in a collection.
///
/// `HTMLForEach` provides a way to generate HTML content by iterating over
/// a collection and applying a transform to each element. This is similar to
/// using a `for` loop in a result builder context, but provides a more
/// explicit and reusable way to handle collection iteration.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
///
/// var content: some HTML {
///     ul {
///         HTMLForEach(fruits) { fruit in
///             li { fruit }
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This would generate HTML similar to:
/// ```html
/// <ul>
///     <li>Apple</li>
///     <li>Banana</li>
///     <li>Cherry</li>
/// </ul>
/// ```
///
/// - Note: This component works around a bug in `buildArray` that causes
///   build failures when the element is `some HTML`.
public struct HTMLForEach<Content: HTML>: HTML {
    /// The array of HTML content generated from the collection.
    let content: _HTMLArray<Content>

    /// Creates a new HTML component that generates content for each element in a collection.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - data: The collection to iterate over.
    ///   - content: A closure that transforms each element of the collection into HTML content.
    public init<Data: RandomAccessCollection>(
        _ data: Data,
        @HTMLBuilder content: (Data.Element) -> Content
    ) {
        self.content = HTMLBuilder.buildArray(data.map(content))
    }

    /// The body of this component, which is the array of HTML content.
    public var body: some HTML {
        content
    }
}
