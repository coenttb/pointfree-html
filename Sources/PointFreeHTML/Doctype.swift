/// Represents the HTML doctype declaration.
///
/// The `Doctype` struct provides a convenient way to add the HTML5 doctype
/// declaration to an HTML document. This declaration is required for proper
/// rendering and standards compliance in web browsers.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// var body: some HTML {
///     Doctype()
///     html {
///         // HTML content...
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Note: In HTML5, the doctype is simplified to `<!doctype html>` compared
///   to the more complex doctypes in earlier HTML versions.
public struct Doctype: HTML {
  /// Creates a new doctype declaration.
  public init() {}
  
  /// The body of the doctype declaration, which renders as raw HTML.
  public var body: some HTML {
    HTMLRaw("<!doctype html>")
  }
}
