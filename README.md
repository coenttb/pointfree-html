# pointfree-html

A Swift DSL for HTML forked from [pointfreeco/swift-html](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/swift-html) and updated to the version on [pointfreeco/pointfreeco](https://github.com/pointfreeco/pointfreeco).

## Overview

HTML is the format of documents. Classic examples of this are web pages and work documents like Microsoft Word and PDF. 

You use `pointfree-html` to create HTML documents using a declarative, SwiftUI-like syntax:

```swift
import HTML
struct Document: HTMLDocument {
  var head: some HTML {
    title { "Hello World" }
  }
  
  var body: some HTML {
    h1 { "Type-safe HTML" }
  }
}
```

The way you generate HTML significantly impacts the quality and maintainability of your documents. Without prioritizing readability and scalability, complexity quickly becomes overwhelming:

  * Generating HTML using raw strings or basic templates **provides no safeguards against syntax errors**, leaving your code vulnerable to mistakes and difficult-to-debug typos.
  
  * Without specialized tools, you **can't easily preview your HTML**, hindering rapid iteration and efficient design adjustments.

These challenges strongly advocate for adopting an abstraction layer for HTML creation—precisely what **PointFreeHTML** provides.

But abstraction is just the start. Once you adopt a library-based approach, you face new questions:

  * How can you **ergonomically generate attributes** without cumbersome raw HTML?

  * How can you **efficiently handle styling**? Traditional style sheets have limitations, and ideally, styling should be intuitive and inline—much like SwiftUI.

PointFreeHTML addresses these concerns comprehensively:

  * It offers a **declarative, type-safe syntax**, similar to SwiftUI, enabling compile-time error checking and drastically reducing tedious formatting mistakes.
  
  * Components are inherently **composable and reusable**, significantly improving code maintainability and scalability.

  * Styles are conveniently applied inline within components, yet are efficiently compiled into optimized CSS with automatically generated unique classes, ensuring high performance without sacrificing ease-of-use.
